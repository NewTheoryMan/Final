        <h1 class="heading">Welcome to Chad Townes' Final</h1>
        <h4 class="heading">The purpose of this website is to showcase my knowledge gained during CSC 250, Web Development.</h4>

    <div class="textbox">
        <h4 style="text-indent: 50px">Introduction</h4>
        <p class="para">I started this course with the expectation to brush up on some rusty skills that I hadn't used since high school.  I took a Intro to Web Development class in which I learned how to implement basic HTML and CSS using Adobe Dreamweaver.  While I retained little of how to make Dreamweaver work for me again, I kept a working knowledge of HTML concepts and practiced making changes to my Myspace account, back when Myspace was cool.  This past year, I created a fun website through <a href="http://weebly.com/" class="link" onclick="if (! confirm('You are about to leave this website.')) { return false; }">Weebly.com</a> and practiced making different website templates that I could go back and edit later.</p>

        <p class="para">At the onset of this course, I had no real programming experience and I only played with markup languages for fun.  I enjoyed getting to turn my resume into an HTML document and then going back on the second project and applying styling to what I had already made in CSS.  It was a nice change from my job as an intelligence analyst where I don't always have tangible results from my hard work.  'I felt really intimidated by Javascript at first, because it was a "new" language, but it is similar to C#, and in some ways much easier to work with.  Being a programming neophyte, I had a hard time grasping some of the concepts of DOM and object-oriented programming, and ended up spending several hours per week watching Youtube tutorials to keep up with the lectures.</p>

        <p class="para">I also enjoyed learning how to make certificates for a user.  I learned about information security while in the Army, but I never got down 'into the weeds' with how to actually create certificates.  I really loved getting to create simple databases with SQL Server.  Manipulating data and analyzing it was my bread and butter for the past six years and getting the chance to build simple databases gave me a real appreciation for those who build the automated tools I've used overseas.</p>

    <div class="textbox">
        <h4 style="text-indent: 50px">Strategy</h4>
        <p class="para">My approach to this final was to work in a group, learning from my classmates and getting to also flex my skills and teach others.   I originally took a business intelligence/design role and worked with my team to develop requirements for our site as well as come up with a good template to work with when drafting up our HTML and CSS.  I don't feel as strong with Javascript, but I planned to at least incorporate some into the site, such as auto-scrolling.  Auto-scrolling works in such a way that when the user attempts to scroll to the next section of a page, some Javascript code will automatically scroll the page down for the user.  Most of my design requests did not make the final cut, and none of my pictures or code did.  I felt that even though my group project was weak, I could at least draft up a new project within the week to prove that I can develop a website on my own that looks better, is more functional, and would hopefully result in a better grade.</p>  

        <p class="para">I don't really care if this improves my grade, because I enjoyed making it and learnign more about web development, which I intend to use throughout my career as an IT professional.</p>

        <p class="para">I wanted this website to have a nice clean and crisp picture as the background, as well as a menu bar that listed out the subjects we covered in class.  I spent most of this past week trying to figure out how to get my drop-down feature to not stay hidden when I hovered the mouse over the menu titles.  I found a good help-guide at<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" class="link" onclick="if (! confirm('You are about to leave this website.')) { return false; }">StackOverflow.com</a>.  Once I knew my navigation was good, I set up all the pages I wanted, as well as linked the CSS and Javascript files.  I found a HTML5 shiv that should correct any old browsers when they view this site, but due to time constraints, I was not able to test that feature.  Also, my Azure account expired and further attempts at hosting it from a different account failed.  However, I was able to at least publish it to my Github account and maintain version control locally.  I learned how to make my copyright statement stick to the bottom of the page and remain centered, no matter what else was on the page.  Also, as part of my rushed design process, I could not find a good excuse to throw in Javascript that didn't look shoe-horned.  I decided that I would like to at least let visitors know when the links take them outside the site with an alert.  I had a hard time getting it to work in my .js file, so temporarily, I hard coded it into each link that exits the page.  Given more time, I would have liked to get it to work in my separate .js file.  I would also like to spend more time tweaking my CSS and testing the site with different platforms (if I was able to actually host it again).  All-in-all, I think this website looks better, is more functional, and is more representational of my skills and knowledge after taking this course.</p>
