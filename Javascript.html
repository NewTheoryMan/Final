        <h4 style="text-indent: 50px">Definition</h4>
        <p class="para">JavaScript is a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and has first-class functions. Its syntax was influenced by C. JavaScript copies many names and naming conventions from Java, but the two languages are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The key design principles within JavaScript are taken from the Self and Scheme programming languages.</p>

        <h4 style="text-indent: 50px">Impression</h4>
        <p class="para">Learning Javascript, at first, was daunting.  I suppose it's that way for nearly every noobie to programming.  I quickly learned that not only is it similar to C#, but in several ways it is easier because it doesn't have as many explicit variable types.  Javascript treats doubles the same as ints.  This made using mathematics in Javascript much easier to use because I was spending less time worrying about semantics and more time coding.  I took a course with Code Academy and found out that I'm a lot better with Javascript than I originally thought.</p>

        <h4 style="text-indent: 50px">Take Away</h4>
        <p class="para">I know that learning coding and being able to effectively use it is what sets amatuer web developers apart from the professionals.  A professional can develop an attractive website, but is not challenged by implementing Javascript or other programming languages that augment the web.  I want to continue to get stronger at writing code by seeing what other people are doing with it, and adapting their code to my needs.</p>
